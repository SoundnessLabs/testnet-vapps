## Developer
- **Name**: Oxy
- **GitHub**: @OxcloneNetwork
- **Discord**: @oxclonefeet
- **Experience**: I am Web3 and crypto ethusisast with strong interest in decentralized applications and zero-knowledge proofs. I have basic coding knowledge and am eager to learn while building my first dApp with Soundness. My focus is on bringing fresh ideas, experimenting, and growing into a capable developer through hands-on experience.

## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: ZeroCast
- **Category**: identity

### Description
**ZeroCast is a secure voting and survey dApp that enables individuals, communities, or DAOs to conduct anonymous yet verifiable polls. Every vote is private, tamper-proof, and recorded on-chain, ensuring both transparency and voter confidentiality. Organizations can run surveys without compromising participant privacy**.
### SL Integratio
- **Use Soundness Layer ZK proofs to allow users to prove eligibility (e.g., membership, ownership, role) without revealing identity**.
- **Use attestations to confirm valid participation and prevent duplicate votes**.
- **Store results with verifiable proofs on-chain for auditability and trust**.

## Technical

### Architecture
- **Voters authenticate anonymously with SL credentials**.
- **Soundness Layer issues ZK-proofs to validate eligibility**.
- **Voting contract records encrypted ballots and prevents double voting**.
- **Results module aggregates tallies and makes them publicly verifiable**.

### Stack
- **Frontend: React + Tailwind**
- **Backend: Node.js / GraphQL**
- **Blockchain: Soundness Layer + Ethereum/Polygon (for DAO voting integration)**
- **Storage: IPFS for encrypted ballots, WALRUS/DB for metadata**

### Features
- **Anonymous but verifiable voting**
- **One-person-one-vote enforcement with attestations**
- **Publicly auditable survey/vote results**
- **DAO integration for governance proposals**
- **User-friendly dashboard for voters & organizers**

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)**
 - **Anonymous login with SL**
 - **Single survey/vote with ZK verification**
- **Minimal UI**

### MVP (4-8 weeks)
 - **Multiple survey/voting types (single choice, multiple choice, ranked)**
 - **DAO integration for governance use cases**
 - **Public results explorer with on-chain proofs**
 - **User testing on testnet**

## Innovation

Traditional voting and surveys compromise either privacy or transparency. ZeroCast combines both — enabling private participation while guaranteeing verifiable, immutable results. Powered by Soundness Layer, it provides a scalable solution for DAOs, communities, and organizations seeking secure governance and trustworthy feedback mechanisms.
